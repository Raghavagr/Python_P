//  Problem Statement:-
 
 Rohan das is a fraud by nature. Rohan Das wrote a python function to print a multiplication table of a given number and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.

Rohan Das did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test. You cannot tolerate this!

So you decided to use your python skills to counter Rohan’s actions by writing a python program that validates Rohan’s multiplication table.

Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in Rohan’s table and expose Rohan Das as a fraud.

Note: Rohan’s function returns a list of numbers like this

Rohan Das’s Function Input:
rohanMultiplication(6)

Rohan’s function returns this output:
[6, 12, 18, 26, …., 60]

You have to write a function isCorrect(table, number) and return the index where rohan’s function is wrong and print it to the screen! If the table is correct, your function returns None

# CODE:
#code
import random

def RohanMultiplication(number):
    #generate one wrong index at which we will make one value wrong.
    wrontind = random.randint(0,9)
    #generate the table of number
    table = [i * number for i in range(1,11)]
    
    #now make the one value wrong at generated wrong index
    table[wrontind] = table[wrontind] + random.randint(0,10)
    return table
    
def isCorrect(table, number):
    for i in range(1,11):
        if table[i-1] != i*number:
            return i
            
    return None
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number = int(input("enter a number\n"))
    myTable = RohanMultiplication(number)
    print(myTable)
    
    #find wrongIndex
    wrongIndex = isCorrect(myTable, number)
    print(f"The table is wrong at index {wrongIndex}")
