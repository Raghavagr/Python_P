Heap Sort Algorithm

step-1) Insert Data to Binary Heap Tree
step-2) Extract Data from Binary Heap

It is best suited with array, it does not work with Linked list

def Heapify(customList, n, idx):
    smallest = idx
    l = 2*idx + 1
    r = 2 * idx + 2
    
    if l < n and customList[idx] < customList[l]:
        smallest = l
        
    if r < n and customList[smallest] < customList[r]:
        smallest = r
        
    if smallest != idx:
        customList[idx], customList[smallest] = customList[smallest], customList[idx]
        Heapify(customList, n, smallest)

def HeapSort(customList):
    n = len(customList)
    for i in range(int(n/2)-1, -1, -1):
        Heapify(customList, n, i)
        
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        customList[i], customList[0] = customList[0], customList[i]
        Heapify(customList, i, 0)
        
    print(customList)
