Binary Heap -> BST wwhich follos the heap property is known as Binary heap.

Heap property - i) every parent node should be less then or equal to child node, which is also called as Min Heap.

                OR)
                
                ii) every parent node should be greater then or equal to child node, which is also called as Max Heap

If BST follows any of this property then it is called binary heap.

To make BST into Heap we perform certain operations which is known as Heapify.

  **  HEAPIFY  **
DEF ->  It is a process to rearrange the elements of the heap in order to maintain the heap property

- The operation ensure that every BST follows heap property.
