// Node Insertion in Graph using Adjacent List

# Graph operations using Adjacency List

## we will maintain dictionary of list to insert node and edges
### key will represent the nodes
### value will represent the list of nodes to which partcular node is connected.

def add_node(node):
    if node in graph:
        print(node, "is already present in graph")
    else:
        graph[node] = [] #empty list because no edge now
        

graph = {}
add_node("A")
add_node("B")
