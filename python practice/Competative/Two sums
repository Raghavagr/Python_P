// Print the index of element if by adding 2 number is equal to target

-> The normal solution we think is off Brute-force using 2 loops but here we will solve it in single loop.

#code
lst = [7, 4, 2, 6]
target = 9
for i in range(len(lst)):
    diff = target - lst[i]
    if diff in lst and i != lst.index(diff):
        print([i, lst.index(diff)])
        break
