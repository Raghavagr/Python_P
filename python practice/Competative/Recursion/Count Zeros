// Count the number of zeros present in a number

## Approach-1
It is simple, you can convert number to string and use count function to count number of zeros

## Approach-2 (RECURSION)
In this we simply call the function multiple times by dividing the number by 10 and everytime check the last digit of number that is it 0 then we 
increase the count by 1 and call the func again.

##CODE
def countZeros(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    if n % 10 == 0:
        return 1+countZeros(n//10)
    else:
        return countZeros(n//10)
        
n = 7080010
print(countZeros(n))
