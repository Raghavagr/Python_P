// Node Insertion in Graph using Adjacent List

# Graph operations using Adjacency List

// URL - https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/ag66saKlPQ

## we will maintain dictionary of list to insert node and edges
### key will represent the nodes
### value will represent the list of nodes to which partcular node is connected.
