A tree is a nonlinear data structure with hirarchical relationship between its elements without having any cycle, it is basically reversed from a real-life tree.

## Properties of tree

- Represent Hirarchical data
- Each Node has 2 components as data and link to its sub-category
- Base category and sub-category under it

## Why Tree Data Structure?

- Quicker and easy access to data
- Store hierarchical data, like folder structure, organization structure, XML/HTML data.

## Tree Terminology

- **Root** - Top node without any parent
- **Edge** - A link between parent node and child node
- **Leaf** - A node that does not have any children
- **sibling** - Children of same parent
- **Ancestor** - Parent, grandparent, great grandparent of a node
- **Depth of node** - a length of the path from root to node
- **Height of a node** - a length of the path from the node to the deepest node
- **Depth of tree** - depth of root node
- **Height of tree** - Height of root node
