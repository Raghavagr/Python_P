************* SELF AND __INIT__() CONSTRUCTOR

// URL: https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/saEAaJ5lia

#code
class Employee:
    no_leaves = 5
    def print_details(self):
        return f"the name is {self.name}\nsal is {self.sal}\nrole is {self.role}"
        

rahul = Employee()   # class object rahul
rahul.name = "rahul"
rahul.sal = 40000
rahul.role = "developer"
print(rahul.print_details())


# Now, what if i want here to give arguments to class like-
#   rahul = Employee("rahul", 40000, "developer")  //like this
# So, to provide arguments to a class object is known as constructor only
# for this we use __init__ in python..
# whener I make the instance of class I want to pass the deatils with it so we make the use of constructor in this.
# EXAMPLE--

class Employee:
    no_leaves = 5
    def __init__(self,newName,newSal,newRole):
        self.name = newName
        self.sal = newSal
        self.role = newRole
    
    def print_details(self):
        return f"the name is {self.name}\nsal is {self.sal}\nrole is {self.role}"
        

rahul = Employee("rahul",40000,"developer")  # rahul object will pass in self.
print(rahul.print_details())
