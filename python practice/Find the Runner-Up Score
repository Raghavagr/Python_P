# Find the runner-up score-> you have to find the second maximum from the list of arrays.

URL:  https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/zdagRNgQId

CODE:
#code

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))   
print(arr)

new_arr = set(arr)

print(max(arr))
new_arr.remove(max(arr))
print(max(new_arr))

# SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT

#INPUT 
3
100 50 100

#OUTPUT
[100, 50, 100]
100
50

# if here we write olly input().split() then it will not be list of array, it will take input in form of string. 
# in this situation it does not work in some situation.
# for eg:- when input contain ['100','50'], then as max it will remove 50 as alphabetic max and give output as 100 to us. which is wrong.


### ALTERNATE SOLUTION (SomeWhat same as above)

# URL: https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/2Wiuvz9NJE

# CODE:
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(arr)

m = max(arr)
arr.remove(m)

k = n-1;

for i in range(k):
    for num in arr:
        if num == m:
            arr.remove(num)
            
runner_up = max(arr)
print(runner_up)

#SAMPLE INPUT
5
3 4 6 5 6

#SAMPLE OUTPUT
[3, 4, 6, 5, 6]
5
