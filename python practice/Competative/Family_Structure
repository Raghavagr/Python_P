## Coding Ninjas Problem Statement
Problem Statement
Aakash is a member of Ninja club. He has a weird family structure. Every male member (M) gives birth to a male child first and then a female child,
whereas every female (F) member gives birth to a female child first and then to a male child. 
Aakash analyses this pattern and wants to know what will be the Kth child in his Nth generation.
Can you help him?

For each test case, print the gender of the Kth child in the Nth generation. If the gender is male, print “Male” else print “Female” (without quotes). 
The output of each test case is printed in a separate line. 

APPROACH - 1 (Naive Approach) -> (TLE IN Big Test Case)

#code
from collections import defaultdict
Gens = defaultdict(list)
Gens[1] = ["Male"]
def KNGen(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return "Male"
    else:
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            getprev = Gens[i-1]
            for ch in getprev:
                if ch == "Male":
                    Gens[i].extend(["Male","Female"])
                else:
                    Gens[i].extend(["Female", "Male"])

n = 4
k = 4
KNGen(n, k)
result = Gens[n]
print(result[k-1])
