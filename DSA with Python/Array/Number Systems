2. Any Base Addition

Logic
- Basically you have to add the number in same base and return answer in same base so what we have done is add two number at back and if greater then base the 
find the remainder and add carry as 1 to next addition because next addition is base times bigger to it which means one.

4. Any Base Multiplication

LOGIC

- Basically extract each digit of N2 and get multiply complete N1 with it in such a way that 6*4 = 24 and number is octat so it is represented as 8^3 + 0 so remainder
  will be 0 and 3 will be added as carry next to it because next number is 8 times which represent that next num is 8*3 times of that. And we have already implemented 
  the sum program so add the result of each digit multiplication using that function.
