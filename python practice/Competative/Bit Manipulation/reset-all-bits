// Given a number in 32-bit update form. You have to reset all the bits after the MSB(most significant bit)

In simple words you have to find most significant bit and after it rest all the bits to 0 means you have to find a small number than a given number
that is power of 2

Eg -> N = 9 (1001)

At third pos there is significant bit and after resetting the number become 8 (1000) so output 8

def resetAllExceptMSB(n):
    # Write you code here.
	#it basically ask to make all the bits after MSB is 0
    #que is equal ti find a number that is small then N
    # and is power of 2
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    msb = 0
    n = int(n/2)
    
    while n > 0:
        n = n//2
        msb += 1
        
    return (1 << msb)
