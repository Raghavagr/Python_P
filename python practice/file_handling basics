FILE HANDLING IN PYTHON

#TEXT FILE
#BINARY FILE

# MODES OF TEXT FILE:- a,r,w,+

# simple program to read the file and display the content

f = open('myfile.txt','r')
b = " "
while(b):
  b = f.read()
  print(b)

# one function is readline to real the data in line
# readlines function is also used to read the data in form of list so that we can perform any operation on it.

f = open('batch2.txt',w)
a = "Good Evening all!
f.write(a)
print("data saved")
b = f.read()
print(b)
f.close()


# It will give a value Error because file is text file and we are inserting int so we have to do it, a='10'.
f = open('batch3.txt',w)
a = 10
f.write(a)
print("data is saved")
f.close()

# upto this we have done append and writing in the file
# if file is open in read mode and you try to write something, then there will be error.

# WE CAN OPEN THE FILE IN 2 MODE AT A TIME USING + MODE
# EX:-

f = open("Batch2.txt",w+)
a = "Good Evening!"
f.write(a)
print("data is saved")               
# if we want to print the content of file after writing in file, then there will be no o/p so we have to bring the fp to 0
f.seek(0) 
print("data in file")
b = f.read()
print(b)
f.close()


# Taking Dynamic input and writing in file.
