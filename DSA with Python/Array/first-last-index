// find first and last index of element in array

// Naive LOGIC

There are 2 logic using a simple linear search O(N) time where in single iteration we get both first and last index

#code
def FirstLastIndex(arr, n, data):
    first = -1
    last = -1
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == data:
            if first == -1:
                first = i
                
            last = i
            
    print(first)
    print(last)

// Binary search Approach

In this we have to apply binary search 2 time to find first idx 1 time and second for last index.
- When we find first idx when data is equal to mid so instead breaking we keep potential idx as first index and mark high as mid-1 to find more same element in left side
- When we find last idx when data is equal to mid so instead breaking we keep potential idx as last index and mark low as mid+1 to find more same element in right side
