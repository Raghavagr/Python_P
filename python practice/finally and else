//  Else and Finally in Try Except

->  when you want to do some task that is compulasary to happen, whther try runs or except runs then, that part of code is written under finally statement.0
# finally is used to clean-up the code
# else is used when except does not runs, the else will run.


#code

#f1 = open("raghav.txt")

try:
    f = open("does2.txt")

   
#except Exception as e:  #you can use exception error in diff ways.
 #   print(e)

#except IOError as i:
 #   print(i)

else:
    print("This will run if except does not running")
    
finally:
    print("run this anyway")
    #f.close()
    #f1.close()


# There can be multiple except statement in program to handle different errors like

except EOFERROR as e:
    print("There is EOF error")
except IOERROR as e:
    print("There is IO error")
