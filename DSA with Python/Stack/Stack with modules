// Create Stack with Modules

-> We can also use Python inbuilt modules to create a stack and perform all its operations

METHOD - 1> USING COLLECTIONS MODULE, USING ITS DEQUE CLASS

- This is same as list and name of functions in deque is also same as append and pop, so one is we can simply use it to create it

METHOD - 2> USING Queue Module

 -  It provides a function as put and get, using which we can create a stack and perform push and pop operations.
 
 // CODE
 
 #code
import queue

def push(stack):
    element = int(input("enter element to push\n"))
    stack.put(element)

def pop(Stack):
    pop_ch = Stack.get()
    print("\npopped element: ", pop_ch)
        
def peek(stack):
    return stack[-1]
    
stack = queue.LifoQueue()
push(stack)
push(stack)
#print("top pos element: ", peek(stack))
push(stack)
pop(stack)
print(stack)
