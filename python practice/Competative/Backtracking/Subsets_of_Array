Given a set of positive integers, find all its subsets. 
Examples: 
 

Input: array = {1, 2, 3}
Output: // this space denotes null element. 
         1
         1 2
         1 2 3
         1 3
         2
         2 3
         3

def findAllSubset(arr, subset, idx):
    
    print(*subset)
    for i in range(idx, len(arr)):
        subset.append(arr[i])
        
        #Recursive call for each forward element
        #so set with 1 element as well as double and further will be in res
        findAllSubset(arr, subset, i+1)
        
        #remove the arr[i] from subset for doing backTracking
        subset.pop(-1)
    return
    
    
arr = [1,2,3]
subset = []
idx = 0
findAllSubset(arr, subset, idx)
