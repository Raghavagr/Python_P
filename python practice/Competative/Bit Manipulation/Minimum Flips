// Find the minimum number of flips required to change A and B equal to C Such that A OR B = C (Using Or operation)

Sample input 
A = 2
B = 6
C = 5

Sample Output
3

Explanation
2 = 0010
6 = 0110

5 = 0101

So, 1st both are having 0, 1 need to be change to ans += 1
    At 2nd pos we want 0 but both bit are 1 so oth need to change ans += 2
    Rest all bit are equal ans = 3

def minFlips(A, B, C):
