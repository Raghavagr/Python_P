PROBLEM STATEMENT:  Take the input from user in given format(name:code,name:code,)
    find the max digit from code which is less than or equal o length of name.
     And put that max place char from name in final string. If there is not such digit which is greater or equal then add "X" to final string
     
 EXAMPLE:
 
 INPUT: Abhishek:34848,Mayus:4739,friends:2949,yeah:9898
 OUTPUT:  kueX

// IMPLEMENTATION

// CODE URL:  https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/dFVdAxshOK

#code
st = input()
name_code = []
final_str = ""

name_code = st.split(",")

for i in name_code:
    temp = i.split(":")
    name = temp[0]
    code = temp[1]
    length = len(name)
    maximum = 0
    # find the max number from code which is <= len of name
    for digit in code:
        if int(digit) <= length:
            if(maximum < int(digit)):
                maximum = int(digit)
    
    if(maximum == 0):
        final_str += "X"
    else:
        final_str += name[maximum-1]

print(final_str)
