def pairSum(arr, s):
    # Write your code here.
    arr.sort()
    res = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        diff = s - arr[i]
        print(diff)
        if diff in arr[i+1:]:
            cnt = arr[i+1:].count(diff)
            while cnt != 0:
                res.append([arr[i], diff])
                cnt -= 1
    return res
    
arr = [2,-6,2,5,2]
print(pairSum(arr, 4))
