// there are many ways to do so
  1) using iterations through list and create dictionary of count
  2) using inbuilt function of python as Counter
  3) using count() function

#code
arr = [10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20, 5, 20]

mydict = {}

for i in arr:
    if i in mydict.keys():
        mydict[i] += 1
    
    else:
        mydict[i] = 1
        
print(mydict)

#using inbuilt func
from collections import Counter
res = Counter(arr)
print(res)
