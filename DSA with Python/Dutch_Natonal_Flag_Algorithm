// Dutch National Flag Algorithm
 
Problem Statement

Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array.

Dutch National Flag algorithm or Three-way partitioning

 
The Dutch National Flag algorithm or three-way partitioning algorithm allows sorting the array consisting of 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single traversal only and in constant space.


Steps:

Maintain three indices low = 0, mid = 0, and high = N-1, where N is the number of elements in the array.
The range from 0 to low denotes the range containing 0s.
The range from low to mid denotes the range containing 1s.
The range from mid to high denotes the range containing any of 0s, 1s, or 2s.
The range from high to N-1 denotes the range containing 2s.

def sort012(arr, n) :

	# write your code here
    # don't return anything 
    # using Dutch National Flag Algorithm
    low = 0
    mid = 0
    high = n-1
    while mid <= high:
        if arr[mid] == 0:
            #swap mid and low
            arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
            
        elif arr[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
            
        elif arr[mid] == 2:
            arr[high], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[high]
            high -= 1
