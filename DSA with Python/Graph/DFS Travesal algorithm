// Depth First Search Travelsal Algorithm in graph

// STEPS TO PERFORM
1) Consider start node as current node and visit that node
2) visit the unvisited adjacent node of current node, make that node as current node
3) Follow step-2 until we reach dead end
4) If unvisited nodes are still remaining in graph then backtrack and take recent visited node as current node and follow step-2

// We use stack to implement DFS Algorithm and one set where order of node visited is stored

Method ->

1) Add the starting node to nodes list, and push all the adjacent nodes of starting node to stack
2) Pop one by one each node from stack and list
3) the node which is popped, Push adjacent nodes of that node to Stack
4) Follow the same process from step-2 to step-3 till stack is empty.

## Why Stack is used?
-> We need Last in first out approach and in stack all the operation is performed at one end only.
-> here we need to pop again the pushed node to stack so we are using stack.

## we are using Adjacency List operation to represent Graph operation that means we are using dictionary to store node and edge

## we will write code using recursive approach first.
