// Created the bubble sort algorithm

In bubble sort we compare the adjacent element and swap them if next is greater then previous.
 -> Means in N-1 passes every adjacent element from start is compared which means after each pass the the greater element will reach at last.
 -> so we require one less pass because after n-1 passes first element will automatic come at its position.
 
- Bubble sort is Stable algorithm
- Bubble sort is not a Adaptable algorithm but we can make it adaptive and code is shown below with adaptivity

def bubbleSort(arr, n):
    for round in range(1, n):
        print(f'Round No: {round}')
        isSorted = 1
        for i in range((n-1-round)+1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                isSorted = 0
                
        if isSorted:
            break

arr = [6,5,2,4,8]
bubbleSort(arr, len(arr))
print(arr)
