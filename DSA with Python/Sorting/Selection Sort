// Selection sort algorithm using Python

- iT IS NOT Adaptable nither Stable algorithm

- In this we iterate n-1 times and select minimum element in array and swap with 0th pos
- Again second time iterate and select 2nd min ele and swap with 2nd pos
- Continue loop till n-1 time and finally array witll be sorted

def selectionSort(arr, n):
    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[min_idx] > arr[j]:
                min_idx = j
                
        #swap minimum element with arr starting positions
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

arr = [6,5,2,4,8]
selectionSort(arr, len(arr))
print(arr)
